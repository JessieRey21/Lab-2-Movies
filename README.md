In class lab for DATA3444 on predicting movie reviews with Naive Bayes Algorithm

Lab Description: You will be exploring an IMDb Movie Review dataset and use it for sentiment analysis. The goal is to classify movie reviews from the
IMDb dataset as either positive or negative based on their text content. You will first do data preparation in order to build a Naive Bayes classifier 
that will predict if the review is positive or negative. The dataset is from the following publication:

Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. (2011). Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis. The 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2011).
